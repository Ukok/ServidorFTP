    El servidor ftp es de gran utilidad para compartir carpetas y archivos alojados quizás es un equipo remoto, y poder
    tenerlos disponibles en la red, siempre y cuando el servidor ftp esté en funcionamiento.
    La configuracion del servidor puede ser tan robusta como se pueda, va desde la configuracion del puerto por donde 
    el servidor estará a la escucha de peticiones, manejo de usuario y hasta enjaular usuarios, es decir, que no puedan 
    accesar a directorios ni archivos propios del servidor.
